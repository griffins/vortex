## Vortex UI

Vortex UI is like a magic wand for front-end development! ðŸª„âœ¨ Just drop a YAML schema into the mix, and watch as your UI components, layouts, and interactions come to lifeâ€”no need to code each element by hand. It's the easiest way to turn a simple idea into a fully functional, customizable web interface. Whether youâ€™re building a simple app or a complex dashboard, Vortex UIâ€™s got your back with style, speed, and a whole lot of ease!

Define your schema and let Vortex do the rest. Itâ€™s like a designer and a developer had a baby, and itâ€™s all about efficiency and style. Backend devs, welcome to the front-end party! ðŸŽ‰

It works out of the box with Laravel and Tailwind CSS, and weâ€™re just getting started! The long-term plan? Adapters for all the popular frameworks, so no matter what stack youâ€™re using.
